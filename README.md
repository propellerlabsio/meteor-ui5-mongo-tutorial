# Meteor-UI5 Mongo Tutorial

This repo contains the completed source for each step of the [Meteor-Ui5 Mongo Tutorial](http://meteor-ui5.propellerlabs.io/#/tutorial/mongo/step/00).  Each step is published in its own branch and continues from the previous step.  Actual tutorial instruction text is published on the website.

## Contributing

Please follow the below guidelines to ensure the tutorial code will be consistently built up across steps:
* **Do not merge changes to master into other branches.**
* **Merge all other changes forward.**  
  If changing something in branch 02, checkout each branch after 02 in succession and merge in the previous branch.  That is a change in branch 02 must be merged into 03, 04, 05 etc until the last branch.  A change in branch 03 would have to be merged into branches 04, 05 etc until the last branch.
